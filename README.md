# ðŸ‘Š Fishel Fitness World Code - End of Day 2 in Class
The code may not look exactly like your classes code, but if you have been absent or just got lost on what we were doing in class here are my files at the end of day 2. The [`fishel.py`](./fishel.py) file is a helper file that can hold other functions we don't want to put into main.py.  It is not necessayr, and only serves right now to fix our date format to mm/dd/yyyy.
